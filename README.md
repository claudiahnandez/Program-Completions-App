# Program-Completions-App
An R app using the shinydashboard library. This app is currently used to track students completing community college programs in which
they received some sort of award (AA, AS, Certificate, ect..). I am not the sole creator of this app. The original code was given to me 
by my boss to improve. I ran with it and this was the result, if you like it you are welcome to use it as a structure. This involved alot 
of using <i>shinyjs</i> to hide boxes and make them reapear depending on what tab you are looking on. I also included a tutorial within
the app itself, you can see in the screenshots at the top right corner.

<strong><i>Note: the code is up but will not run on R studio because it needs immediate access to a server for the school I work for.
For security resons, this server is not accessible. A link to the app will be posted soon...</i></strong>
